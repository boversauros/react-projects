# Search movies

## Project Description

You have been asked to create a movie search application using the OMDB API (https://www.omdbapi.com/). The application should allow users to search for movies by title and display a list of results. Each result should display the movie title, release year, and poster image. Users should also be able to click on a movie to view additional details, including the plot summary and a list of cast members.

## Requirements

- Use React to build the application.
- Use the OMDB API to fetch movie data.
- Implement search functionality that allows users to search for movies by title.
- Display a list of search results, including the movie title, release year, and poster image.
- Implement pagination for search results, with each page displaying up to 10 results.
- Allow users to click on a movie to view additional details, including the plot summary and a list of cast members.
- Display a loading indicator while data is being fetched.
- Handle errors gracefully (e.g., display an error message if the API request fails).

## Bonus Points

- Implement autocomplete functionality that suggests movie titles as the user types in the search field.
- Allow users to filter search results by genre or rating.
- Implement client-side caching to reduce API requests.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality:** Does the application meet the requirements and work as expected?
- **Code Quality:** Is the code clean, maintainable, and well-documented?
- **User Experience:** Is the application easy to use and visually appealing?
- **Technical Skills:** Does the applicant demonstrate proficiency with React, CSS, and API integration?
